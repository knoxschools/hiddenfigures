excerpt: "Ideological differences were a source of discrimination in his life, rather than racial or gender-based discrimination"

Most studies of discrimination focus on issues of race and gender. However, we will soon see that discrimination can also be applied to ideological categorization.

The nuclear program is very similar in nature to the Space Race (which was the setting for Hidden Figures), as it was a government-funded effort to advance technology. Lots of the research performed at Los Alamos and ORNL directly helped the efforts during the Space Race. For example, most theoretical chemistry and physics involving combustion and propulsion was researched and developed at Los Alamos and ORNL. This directly helped us build rockets later.

Robert Oppenheimer worked at the Los Alamos Labratory, where he developed the nuclear weapons program. All his life, he was involved with efforts around the globe that many in the US Government disagreed with. He was a victim of McCarthyism, and during a trial in 1954, he was stripped of most of his credentials for alleged communist ties.


Here are a few examples of his activities they took offense to:

  * He dated a communist writer (Jean Tatlock) and they shared many political beliefs. Tatlock was an actual member of the Communist Party of America, and Oppenheimer met her through his landlord, also a Communist Party member.
  * After that, he dated and then married another party member (Katherine Harrison)
  * Oppenheimer's brother, and his brother's wife were also Communist Party members
  * Oppenheimer write that he was a part of "just about every Communist Front organization on the West Coast" and that he "was associated with the Communist movement"
  * Oppenheimer was a part of the ACLU, which the FBI actually considered a "Communist organization".
  * Alleged meetings with Soviets in order to give away nuclear secrets


With this sum of evidence that the FBI found objectionable and actionable, they ultimately revoked his security clearance, and thus destroyed his academic status.


This also lead to the seperation of science and influence. Oppenheimer was trying to be both a scientifically useful citizen, but also a role model for morality. However, his treatment by the FBI set up a precedent that essentially silenced academics from speaking out on social equality issues:

> In a few years after World War II, scientists had been regarded as a new class of intellectuals, members of a public-policy priesthood who might legitimately offer expertise not only as scientists but as public philosophers. With Oppenheimer's defrocking, scientists knew that in the future they would serve the state only as experts only on narrow scientific issues. As sociologist Daniel Bell later observed, Oppenheimer's ordeal signified that the postwar "messianic role of the scientists" was now at an end. Scientists working within the system could not dissent from government policy, as Oppenheimer had done by writing his 1953 Foreign Affairs essay, and still expect to serve on government advisory boards. The trial thus represented a watershed in the relations of the scientist to the government. The narrowest version of how American scientists should serve their country had triumphed.


Even though Oppenheimer was straight, white, and male, he was still silenced for having thoughts and associations dealing with social equality. Ultimately, the above block quote definitely affected the upcoming Space Race, as it made scientists and researchers scared to speak up about social inequalities. This case probably affected how willing Katherine Johnson's (and any other oppressed people's) coworkers were to speak about the social inequalities they faced.

Oppenheimer's case represented how the government, and radical conservatives, could silence and oppress people, especially within scientific or academic settings.

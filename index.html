										Unfortunately, discrimination has been very present in our country's history <br />
                    It has happened for a number of reasons, including gender, race, and ideology<br />
										Here are some examples of how it has happened in the past
									</p>
								</header>

								<p>
									The FBI, and other government agencies, have been instrumental in silencing (and thus oppressing) minority groups in science and technological settings. <br/> <br/>

									They have done this based on race (colored bathrooms for instance), gender (not allowing women to apply for "manly" jobs for instance), and even ideology (destroying someone's reputation for speaking out against social inequality for instance). Indeed, these all have a chilling effect on the struggle for civil rights issues. <br/> <br/>

									The effects can be seen in <i>Hidden Figures</i> (book which was made into a movie), although it's hardly restrained to that. <i>Hidden Figures</i> is just one example of this unfair treatment, and it's not even over yet. We need to learn from our past mistakes, and look forward to improve the setting of our science research and academic workplaces, and indeed society in general. <br/> <br/>
